# About Me

Hello! I’m Tanzee Sarwar, a student at the Governor House, currently enrolled in the IT Program. I have a strong passion for technology and web development. Through my studies and personal projects, I am honing my skills in various frameworks and tools, with a particular interest in Next.js, API development, and front-end design.

# Project Overview

This project was developed for a hackathon where I leveraged **API routes**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **custom CSS** to build a fully functional and responsive furniture chair website. The design was based on a **Figma template**, which I meticulously translated into code, focusing on clean and optimized design, as well as seamless user experience.
